# Stack-DataStructure-Example

## This project is a tested implementtation of a Stack Data Structure written in C

To use this project you will need to create your own main/controller function as the methods created are meant to be general use methods. 

For these base methods a node struct is used to store each node's information including a name and a pointer which points to the next node. You can push/pop nodes onto/off of the stack however many times you wish for a look at how the data structure operates. To view the end contents of your stack there is also a printing method for displaying the resulting information stored.
